hpet: HPET IA-PC High Precision Event Timer Table tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 4: Test HPET base in kernel log.
This test checks the HPET PCI BAR for each timer block in the timer. The base
address is passed by the firmware via an ACPI table. IRQ routing and
initialization is also verified by the test.
No base address found for HPET in the kernel log.

Test 2 of 4: Test HPET base in HPET table.
FADT X_FIRMWARE_CTRL 64 bit pointer was zero, falling back to using
FIRMWARE_CTRL 32 bit pointer.
Hardware ID of Event Block:
  PCI Vendor ID              : 0x8086
  Legacy IRQ Routing Capable : 1
  COUNT_SIZE_CAP counter size: 1
  Number of comparitors      : 2
  Hardwre Revision ID        : 0x1
Lower 32 bit base Address    : 0xfed00000
  Address Space ID           : 0x0
  Register Bit Width         : 0x40
  Register Bit Offset        : 0x0
  Address Width              : 0x0
HPET sequence number         : 0x0
Minimum clock tick           : 0x80
Page Protection              : 0x0 (No guaranteed protection)
OEM attributes               : 0x0
PASSED: Test 2, HPET looks sane.

Test 3 of 4: Test HPET base in DSDT and/or SSDT.
Test skipped because HPET address was not found.

Test 4 of 4: Test HPET configuration.
Test skipped because HPET address was not found.
